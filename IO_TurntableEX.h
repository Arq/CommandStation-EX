/*
* The IO_TurntableEX device driver is used to control a turntable via an Arduino Nano with a stepper motor over I2C.
*
* The Nano code lives in a separate repo (https://github.com/DCC-EX/Turntable-EX) and contains the stepper motor logic.
*
* This device driver sends an integer/byte to the Nano to indicate the position to move to using an EX-RAIL SERVO
* command, with the position in place of the PWM value. The profile value is used to flag phase/polarity switching
* or other activities as defined in Turntable-EX.
*
* For example, a ROUTE used for position one:
*
* ROUTE(600, "Layout connection")
*   SERVO(600, 1, Instant)
*   DONE
